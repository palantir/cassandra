/**
 * Executing a single compaction task requires two flushes of the system.compactions_in_progress table: at start and
 * finish. These flushes are blocking and a forced flush itself is synchronized so only one flush can happen at a time.
 * On nodes with considerable compaction task throughput and concurrency, these flushes pose a number of problems:
 * - they needlessly bottleneck the compaction rate by having to wait on all flushes to occur serially despite the
 *   compactions themselves running in parallel
 * - they generate lots of very tiny sstables in the system.compactions_in_progress table that in turn must be
 *   compacted together and thus further contribute to this issue
 *   
 * The rest of this explanation operates under the assumption that these blocking flushes are indeed required, and that
 * they exist to ensure that the data written immediately before the forceBlockingFlush exists in an sstable on disk
 * before continuing on to the next phase of the compaction.
 * 
 * When two independent compactions A and B both execute a write to this table and then call the forceBlockingFlush, if
 * both A and B have fully completed their write before either has attempted to run their flush, we can conclude that
 * either tasks flush will have the affect of flushing the other tasks data as well. In this case we need only execute
 * one flush, not two.
 * 
 * This class attempts to abstract away calling forceBlockingFlush on the system.compactions_in_progress table and
 * transparently tracking and managing when and how flushes occur in order to minimize the number of flushes actually
 * executed without altering any of the guarantees supplied by the forceBlockingFlush method.
