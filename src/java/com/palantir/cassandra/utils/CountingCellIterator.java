/**
 * A wrapper around {@link MergeIterator} specifically for {@link Cell} objects and for use in {@link SliceQueryFilter}
 * that counts the number of cells read and processed from disk for the purposes of understanding performance
 * bottlenecks and cluster behavior. Cell types counted are:
 * - live: cells that have real data and are not an expired TTL; this does not represent exact correctness in that
 *         a cell that is considered deleted by a higher level deletion like a row level delete will be marked as
 *         live here because we had to read it.
 * - tombstone: tombstones that have not yet passed their gc_grace_seconds period
 * - droppableTombstone: a tombstone that is gc-able as it is past its gc_grace_seconds period
 * - droppableTtl: a TTL'ed (formerly live) cell that is now gc-able as it is past its time-to-live.
